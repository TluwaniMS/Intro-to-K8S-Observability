# Intro-to-K8S-Observability

# What is observability ?

The traditional definition of observability with regards to distributed systems has been based on three pillars; 

collecting time-based metrics, aggregating logs, and performing traces of requests as they flow through your system.

# The three pillars of observability:

* Metrics
* Logs
* Tracing


# Monitoring:

# The two types of monitoring: 

i. Blackbox Monitoring:
* Measurement from outside
* Hardware issues
* CPU load average
* Hypervisor-level metrics

ii. Whitebox monitoring:
* Inside Knowledge of a system
* Mysql Query time 
* HTTP Requests
* Service Traffic Patterns


`NB!`

`Observability provides both blackbox and white box monitoring, to give more context.`
